# SignFlow

A mobile-first SaaS prototype for secure PDF signing. SignFlow is a React + TypeScript (Vite) frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling and a mock Express.js backend that accepts PDF uploads, simulates a signing operation, and returns a "signed" PDF. The repo is organized as a single monorepo with `/src` (frontend) and `/server` (Express mock API).

Core goals: mobile-first UX, fast performance (lazy loading, code splitting), smooth Framer Motion transitions, clear folder structure, and strong testability (Jest + React Testing Library).
